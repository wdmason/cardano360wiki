00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,070
yt5s.com-Cardano360 March 2022:
Welcome to your March edition of

2
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,550
Cardano, 360, your monthly catch-up
with the people and projects

3
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,439
building out the Cardona ecosystem.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,610
Now, before we begin, make sure you
like subscribe and hit that bell icon

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,180
for all the latest Cardona content
and news from the team here at.

6
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,975
Later in the show, we'll be checking
in with Kevin, John, and Nigel for a

7
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:35,895
preview of the June vessel hard fork.

8
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,805
We'll also meet a new member of
the team, head of ecosystem growth,

9
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:42,255
Morgan Scofield, to find out more
about a central car Dano, a new

10
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,265
site, covering all things, cut on it.

11
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:47,805
And if you're into dogs and NFTs, you
might want to stick around till the

12
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:49,425
end for a bit of a special message.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,880
Well with that slightly cryptic note,
let's start with something a little

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,190
more tangible yield and liquidity.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,270
Now, earlier this week, Wei financial
announced a new fund, and I had an

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,870
opportunity to catch up with IOG his
nickname back to learn more about

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,310
this new program wave CEO, David
Sima, and Ken Kadama from Emergo

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,770
will also drop by to say a few words.

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,070
So Nick welcome.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,940
Now, as I understand it, this fund is
ultimately about driving liquidity and

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,520
supporting growth for defy on Cardona.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,270
Yes.

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,310
The objective of the fund is to
help jumpstart the defined ecosystem

24
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,710
by providing liquidity for a
lot of dApps, specifically Dexis

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:39,070
and lenders to help bring total
value locked or TVL on chain to.

26
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:43,905
Perhaps you can explain what we mean
by liquidity and why projects need it

27
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:46,725
in early stages and defy ecosystems.

28
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:52,274
It's important to enable a good user
experience for things like swaps.

29
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:57,645
So when there's adequate liquidity in a
Dex or within a decentralized exchange,

30
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:04,095
you need that to facilitate trading
activity and to have trade executions

31
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:06,014
happen in a timely manner for users.

32
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,025
Liquidity is a pretty
fundamental concept and.

33
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:16,065
There needs to be an adequate amount
of a given resource or a currency or

34
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:20,204
a token in this particular case or
pairs of tokens more specifically.

35
00:02:20,204 --> 00:02:25,545
So in defy, there's often pairs of
tokens that are set up with each other

36
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:31,695
in a pool so that when trades occur,
they can happen in a timely fashion and

37
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:37,095
they can literally help the liquidity
providers gain a return on those assets.

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,910
As a liquidity provider, I put
in a certain amount of an asset

39
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,040
or a token, and I generally see
rewards or return for doing so.

40
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,160
And as a user who executes a swap these,
these balanced pools of assets are used

41
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,420
to literally execute the mechanics of
those swaps behind the scenes and, you

42
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,200
know, make trades go through and within
a certain number of milliseconds often.

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,475
And if you don't have enough, Then
those traits can occur in that time.

44
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:08,835
We fashioned and essentially, you know,
a lot of these exchanges will struggle to

45
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:10,725
perform within a certain amount of time.

46
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:13,815
So now we talk a lot about collaboration
and partnership and these being

47
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:15,585
key to growth of the ecosystem.

48
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:19,575
We'll hear from Ken, from Emergo,
and also from David Siemer wave in a

49
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:23,475
moment, but from an IOT perspective,
what's the ultimate goal here from an

50
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:28,245
IOT perspective, our goal is always to
support our community and developers

51
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:29,595
are number one in our committee.

52
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,445
And demonstrate that they're number one.

53
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:37,274
We are backing investment
managers like wave.

54
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:43,545
And so our, our partners in terms of
Emergo and this way we can not only

55
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:50,204
provide very clear ways of, of supporting
the ecosystem, but also generate

56
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:53,475
initial activity and trading volumes.

57
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:57,465
And, you know, at certain key Dexis
that also within lenders as well,

58
00:03:57,465 --> 00:04:01,185
so that people who don't have access
to certain types of lending can

59
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:03,045
get access, which is our charter.

60
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:08,655
Hi, I'm David Siemer a founder and CEO of
wave financial wave is an sec registered

61
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:10,095
wealth and asset management platform.

62
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,403
We are the managers of CX.

63
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:16,589
The early stage ecosystem fund
designed to support a, to focus

64
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,600
companies at the earliest stage.

65
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,800
Now we're very excited to launch this new
vehicle called the wave 80 yield fund.

66
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,350
The purpose of this fund to support
a lot of those same companies,

67
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,010
plus other ones that are building
decentralized finance applications.

68
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,310
So obviously when those companies need
support, the most is at the earliest stage

69
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,469
when they're first launching and that's.

70
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:38,030
We, our goal is to fill up
the TBL of those platforms.

71
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,860
Make sure there's a good user experience.

72
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,210
The trade pairs are robust.

73
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,590
There's always something to trade against.

74
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,910
So it just w w kind of a continuation
of our support from this from

75
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,350
C fund at the earliest stage.

76
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,570
So this fund has already
a nine figure vehicle.

77
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,690
It's going to continue to
grow pretty rapidly, and we're

78
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,590
really excited to be, to manage.

79
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,580
Hi everybody.

80
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,935
RD support to stay IOG way.

81
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:36,405
Stop stare.

82
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:37,205
If I know

83
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:40,845
Thank you.

84
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:46,455
Singularity net is merging artificial
intelligence with blockchain

85
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,035
technology through their AGI X token.

86
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:53,385
Eric sat down with CEO, Ben Gursel to
talk about bringing the token to Cardona

87
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:58,605
with their AGI X to ADA ERC 20 token
converter launching on April the 18th.

88
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:01,725
Now you can catch the conversation
in full on YouTube, right after

89
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,525
this, but meanwhile, here's a clip.

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,180
So today we're joined by Ben Gursel
the CEO of singularity net, and

91
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,270
one of the world's leading thinkers
and artificial intelligence.

92
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,840
So welcome to the show, Ben, and
maybe you can start off by telling

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,290
us a little bit about what the
intersection between blockchain

94
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,940
technology and artificial intelligence
actually is blockchain and AI.

95
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,950
Foundational technologies for, for
that the next few decades, they're

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,729
both key parts of, of creating a
beneficial technological singularity,

97
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,159
which is really, really what I'm
after with, with all of my science

98
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,860
and engineering and other work.

99
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,650
And I do think AI in a way.

100
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,410
The foundational technology.

101
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,810
I mean, if you can make a machine
smarter than people and benevolently

102
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,450
oriented toward people, then as I J
good said in 1965, like the first truly

103
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,290
intelligent machine will be the last
invention that humanity needs to make.

104
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:07,530
Right.

105
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,510
So in a way, AI potentially trumps
everything on, on the other hand.

106
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:17,205
How do you get to that AI that,
that trumps everything right?

107
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:24,075
And, and one key aspect, when one
thinks about the, the advent of AI

108
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:29,685
in the next years and decades is
who owns the AI, who controls the AI

109
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:34,425
based on what set of inputs is the AI
learning and evolving and developing.

110
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:40,094
And this is really where blockchain
comes in because using blockchain as

111
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:48,000
a foundation for AI, Allows AI to be
controlled in a decentralized manner

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,640
without any single point of failure,
without any single point of control.

113
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,860
So where does the AGI token come into
all of this for singularity net for

114
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,040
the blockchain aspect of, of course
we launched singularity net running

115
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,950
on Ethereum pretty much because.

116
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:09,525
It was there.

117
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:13,515
It was easier to work with Ethereum
smart contracts and to build their

118
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:17,625
own blockchain or to build on top
of, of Bitcoin, which didn't have as

119
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,935
mature of a smart contract framework.

120
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,535
I was never incredibly happy with.

121
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,660
If they're even, I mean, I love the
Ethereum guys and the philosophy of a

122
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,180
world's computer is, is kick-ass right.

123
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,470
But that celebrity is not a very
advanced programming language.

124
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,980
If you look at the modern theory of,
of programming languages and computer

125
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,980
science and proof of proof of work
in, in the form that you have in

126
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,840
Bitcoin or Ethereum didn't ever turn
me on too much, just because of the.

127
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,560
Hastening the heat death of the
universe unnecessarily and, and the

128
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,270
heat death of the planet as well.

129
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,569
Right.

130
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,610
So when, when I saw Cardona emerging,
based on Haskell as a smart contract

131
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,900
language, which is, which is.

132
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:12,375
Fundamentally superior programming
approach, just slightly what

133
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,235
web assembly and so forth.

134
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:18,975
And, and without this legacy of proof
of work to overcome either, it was

135
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:24,255
very appealing to move, to move the
underlayer of singular unit until.

136
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:26,015
Cardona.

137
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:30,585
Let's talk about the the process for
migrating from Ethereum to Cardona.

138
00:09:30,795 --> 00:09:31,905
What does that look like for you guys?

139
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:37,485
We're looking at putting the bulk of
our effort in singularity net on the

140
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:42,735
Cardinal version version of the platform,
rather than the legacy Ethereum version.

141
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:47,955
So there's done a series of steps
after that April 18th converted launch.

142
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:52,225
So, I mean the, the next one
will probably be staking of

143
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:54,195
AIX, ADA tokens, just because.

144
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,075
A fairly straightforward thing to do.

145
00:09:57,075 --> 00:10:04,215
And we, the staking rewards, well, we
haven't worked out all the details,

146
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:06,825
but what will probably be more
appealing than on the Ethereum version.

147
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:11,685
So we'll be, we'll be pulling pulling more
of a community who likes taking into the,

148
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:15,555
into the, the ADA native asset community.

149
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:20,935
Then the bigger step after that,
we'll be putting the whole single.

150
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:26,115
Marketplace onto, onto Cardona.

151
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:29,745
And that's, that's more of a technical
step cause we have some fairly

152
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:33,825
sophisticated sort of multi-party
escrow wallet system and so on.

153
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:38,865
And the, in the platform, we need to get
that all running in, in PLU, this then

154
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:45,075
that following step after that, which
is even further in the future, I've been

155
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,755
putting a bunch of time in the last few.

156
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,720
Into designing a new cargo side
chain customized for AI, which

157
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,760
is called, called hyper cycle.

158
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,270
Well, thank you so much for joining
us, really looking forward to

159
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,490
literally all the things that
you're coming out with soon.

160
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,090
And remember, if you want to check out
that interview in full with Ben, the link

161
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,590
is below and you can also find out more
about singularity nets, latest music.

162
00:11:12,495 --> 00:11:15,375
So it all started with a small
but passionate community.

163
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:20,745
And since 2017, we've grown into a
fully fledged ecosystem of millions over

164
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:24,285
the past few months, that growth has
turned into something quite remarkable.

165
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:29,625
Now we recently hit something of a
milestone with 4 million tokens surpassed

166
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:34,005
and a couple of weeks ago, our research
identified around 500 projects building

167
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:36,344
on Cardone, but we have a confession to.

168
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,590
We got it wrong because last week
we did some further social sleuthing

169
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,640
and a bit of deeper digging.

170
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,360
And in fact, we revealed a whole new
bunch of projects building on Cardona.

171
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,040
We're now tracking nearly 900
projects from Dexis and defy to

172
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,000
of course our incredible CNF.

173
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:55,905
It's incredible growth and really
we're only just getting started,

174
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:58,845
but for newcomers, getting up
to speed can be pretty daunting.

175
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:02,265
There's some great sites out there
like Cardona queue building on CUDA,

176
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:06,135
Arno built on called Dano, ADA pulse
and many more, but we wanted to do our

177
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:09,945
bit and add to the options with the
newest central padano site and natural

178
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:13,665
evolution of the existing crowdsource
repo, where developers and creators

179
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:18,315
building on Cod Dano can log their
project from simple repo to rich directory

180
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:19,725
with Cardone technical essential.

181
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,430
And network updates.

182
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,750
Here's Morgan Schofield, our new head
of ecosystem growth to walk us through

183
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,760
how this community centric site now in
closed beta will enable seasoned cut on

184
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,870
a pros and newcomers alike, like to learn
more and to educate others on the ins

185
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,640
and outs of our incredibly existence.

186
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,990
Let's find out more.

187
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,340
Hi, it's great to be part of the 360
show and the team behind a central.

188
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:52,380
Central got Arnaud is a community
driven living directory of resources,

189
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,980
built to showcase the incredible
ecosystem building on Caetano.

190
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,660
We built this to be the source of truth
for you, the community to rally around and

191
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,040
to get access to the resources that allow
you to be the champions for the network

192
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,810
and the future of the Catano platform.

193
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,750
It's important to note that
this is not a competitor.

194
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,410
We really want this to be
built, to feature and showcase.

195
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:15,944
Projects that you're already working on.

196
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:19,845
If you are a community member, building
projects on the crown and network, use

197
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:25,035
this as an opportunity to showcase your
projects, to elevate and illustrate

198
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:26,625
what your team are working on.

199
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:28,185
The ask is really simple.

200
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:33,375
We would love the community to come
together and contribute to make this their

201
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,235
living directory of vibrant resources.

202
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:40,305
It can be think of this like a Wiki page
for Caetano and most likely Wiki page.

203
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,730
It takes the people and the
community around it to build

204
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,110
it into the valuable resource.

205
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,960
It can be the types of formats and content
that you can upload our videos, podcast,

206
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:57,060
audio articles developer resources,
really the sky's the limit here.

207
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,670
We built this to be an
open source directory.

208
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,040
So every time you do upload
something, There's an opportunity

209
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,939
for you to collaborate comment
upvote and to peer review.

210
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:09,490
What others in the
community are talking about.

211
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:11,439
This we'll start in beta mode.

212
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,960
We'll be releasing the website in April
for an open beta for the community to

213
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,790
come and contribute to the URL you should
look out for is the central caetano.io

214
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,130
contributions will be visible on Twitter.

215
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,189
And the hashtag that you should
look out for is a central

216
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:29,620
Catano or building on card.

217
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:33,045
Now let's turn to a quick
demo of the Caetano platform.

218
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,705
This is what a central Cardona
will start looking like.

219
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:38,775
This is the homepage landing page.

220
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:42,855
You'll be able to find any answers
you're looking for about the Caetano

221
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:47,445
project or the community around
it, much like a Reddit or a Wiki.

222
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:51,915
The most important thing is the community
adding and contributing to the resource

223
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:53,615
to contribute to your central kudos.

224
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,525
Super easy.

225
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:58,155
You just click on this big call
to action and it's as simple

226
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,475
as two clicks you can fill out.

227
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:04,335
The details of what you want to upload
once you've submitted it, that will

228
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:09,975
go to the community for review peer
review and will be eventually published

229
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,135
on at the central Cardone platform.

230
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:12,944
Thanks.

231
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:17,925
It's been really great being part of the
show and feel free to add me on Twitter.

232
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:21,795
My handle is empty Scofield, or just
search my name, Morgan Scofield.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,600
So keep an eye out for central
Cardona coming out of beta very soon.

234
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,230
Meanwhile, you can subscribe to the
new essential Cardona newsletter

235
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,800
for ecosystem updates, news, and
features right to your inbox.

236
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,910
The link is below.

237
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,620
Building a global financial
operating system means scaling

238
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,390
from millions to billions of users.

239
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,350
Hydro will play an important part of
that journey with the first iteration

240
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,410
of the protocol already on Testnet
and being rolled out this year.

241
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,640
Let's hear the latest on progress
from hydro engineer, Sebastian Noggle

242
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,770
Sebastian.

243
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,420
Welcome back to cut on a 360.

244
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,090
Now you and the team have recently
reached quite an important model.

245
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,780
That's correct.

246
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,200
One or two weeks ago, we opened the first
hydro hats on the public Kadana Testnet.

247
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:13,170
So far we have been using local
development networks for, for

248
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,560
testing and really tinkering with
our hydro nodes implementation.

249
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:20,010
But this time we were like targeting
the public Kadana Testnet, which

250
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,120
is very important to test out the
behavior on the network, which is

251
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,000
very similar to the main net as it
has the same pair of meters latency.

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,090
And.

253
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,695
So Sebastian version zero four
is is an important new version.

254
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:31,965
Isn't it?

255
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:36,795
Yeah, just recently we cut the release
zero four, which is the first version,

256
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,605
which can talk to corral Testnet as it
was the one we used for our hackathon.

257
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:44,505
When we actually connected the first time
to look at our Testnet, it is working.

258
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:48,225
It is already usable, but
it's tricky to use, right?

259
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:50,655
So there is lots of things
you would need to know.

260
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:51,285
Try out.

261
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,065
It's a test enough.

262
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,400
And so there is still some things
you need to know, or for example,

263
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,640
some, sometimes you cannot close
the head or something like that.

264
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,420
So this is the first version which
can talk to the cadaver tests,

265
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,589
but it will not be the last one.

266
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:04,829
Right?

267
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,819
So we are already planning and working
on the next version, zero five, which

268
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,050
we'll have noticeable improvements
on, for example, handling rollbacks,

269
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,220
which are not done right now.

270
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,300
Of course, we need to do that.

271
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,280
One of the main things we're working
on right now and overall the next

272
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,089
version, zero five, we'll make it
a bit easier to use more robust to

273
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,400
use even on the test net and yeah.

274
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,380
Increase the maturity and the robustness
of the whole system as we go along.

275
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,780
So is there anything that the
community can do right now?

276
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,749
Release zero four came
with a new documentation.

277
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,620
We even have a new website,
which is a couple of.

278
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,900
And so head over to HydroDrop family,
a domain name, it couldn't pass.

279
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,740
And so we just use it for hosting
documentation for our work, for the work

280
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,000
on the hydro head protocol, noticeably
instructions, how to try it out, how to do

281
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,340
the demo, set up and use the hydro node.

282
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,990
And it will also contain as
we go along more in details

283
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,690
on the core concepts behind.

284
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:11,625
It will contain information about
deployment models and example use cases,

285
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:16,995
maybe how to use hydro hats and of course,
technical details like the API reference

286
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,035
can also be found there and going forward.

287
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,055
What's the next steps.

288
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:23,520
Of course, we keep on working on
implementing the hydro head protocol.

289
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:28,215
There's more leases to come as we should
see, not by now that we try to aim on

290
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:30,345
a frequent and regular release cadence.

291
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:34,115
People are expecting a main
net release of hydro insurance.

292
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:39,105
This might happen, but I want to
say something about it really,

293
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:41,445
that there is no Dooley's of hydro.

294
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,504
We had a couple of versions before,
and we'll have a couple of versions as

295
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:49,004
we go along becoming mature enough to
handle transactions on the main net.

296
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:52,815
So hydro deploying hydro is not
really like flipping a switch and

297
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,135
everything will be fast and cheap.

298
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:58,725
It's more that we build a foundation,
a piece of technology that the

299
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:03,195
builders of  can actually use and
to use, to create fast and cheap.

300
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:09,225
So as we enable our users, which is
the developers of  and developers on

301
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:13,725
Kadana use Hydra and use hydro head,
you will see some use cases become

302
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:15,405
a bit quicker, but cheaper to use.

303
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:18,795
And this is how we basically will roll
up hydro over the next couple of months.

304
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:22,725
Not another thing I would like to address
is quickly that there is no need for

305
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:25,155
a half work for hydro to be existing.

306
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:27,915
So also means that hydro
is not part of the next.

307
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:32,475
It will be benefit greatly from
the improvements, what we'll

308
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:36,345
get from the June Hartford and
maybe potentially improvements

309
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,815
we get from the October Hartford.

310
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:42,615
So hydro hats, people become more capable
by doing, by having these benefits,

311
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:44,865
but it's not strictly tied to it.

312
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:49,785
We will see releases of Hydra, the Hydra
note before, between, and after these.

313
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:53,129
So indeed, that's an
important point to Sebastian.

314
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:56,370
Now, if any folks watching this
want to get more involved in the

315
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,929
hydro journey, what can they do?

316
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,200
Okay.

317
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,350
Always, I would like to encourage
the community and especially

318
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,850
developers of our criminal community
to try what we've taught head

319
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,429
over to the hybrid.family website.

320
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,770
You will see communication
channels in the bottom.

321
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,440
We would like to hear from your
experience, from your successes,

322
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,389
from your failures, even, and improve
on how, what we can do and how.

323
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,320
Basically at the things you need
learn from your requirements

324
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:29,400
and yeah, help basically scaling
Kadana make it more capable and

325
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,200
ideally more adopted in the future.

326
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,770
Tara Virtua has been one of the pioneers
in digital art, collectibles and virtual

327
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,870
worlds in recent years and coming next
to Cardona NFTs and the metaverse Erik

328
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,680
caught up with Tara virtuous CEO, Joanne
dash RAF to find out what's happening.

329
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,220
NFTs and the metaverse are
critical areas for  to expand into.

330
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,490
And we are fortunate that we have
quite a few community projects that

331
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,050
are working in this area today.

332
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,420
We're joined by CEO of
Terra Virtua, Jawad.

333
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,070
Osheroff to talk a little bit about
Terra Virtua and how they're building the

334
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,040
metaverse with NFTs on Cardinal Jawad.

335
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,850
Welcome to the show.

336
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,660
And maybe you can start off by telling us
a little bit about the mission of terror.

337
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:16,575
Hi, I'm Eric.

338
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:20,145
Basically the mission of Tara
virtual right now is coming back

339
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,515
to where we started back in 2017.

340
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:29,115
We set up a metaverse in VR with
NFTs and realized back in 2018, no

341
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,285
one understood what any of those.

342
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,930
So essentially we doubled down on
NFTs and focused on being like a

343
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,700
premier NFT platform, respecting
IPS and working with AAA brands.

344
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,840
Ultimately our vision and our mission
was to create a whole metaverse

345
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,010
ecosystem and NFTs the digital
assets, underpin all of those.

346
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,260
So why decide to build Terra Virtua?

347
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,480
The the metaverse the whole ecosystem.

348
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,909
Why decide to work with Cardinal on this?

349
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,849
You look at the technology.

350
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,340
You, you look at the vision
of the people involved and you

351
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,570
look at the community as well.

352
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,149
So all three factors play together.

353
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:12,190
So when we started, we focused very much
in Ethereum, but then we were looking at

354
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,440
having like a really solid EVM partner.

355
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,360
Generally the team, the community, every
aspect of car dollar, the screens was

356
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,920
that this is a great place to build.

357
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,610
And so we basically collaborated
at the last conference.

358
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,200
And since then, we've been working
hand in hand with, with Cardona and

359
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,320
actually building out new technology
layers that will actually help the

360
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:40,160
whole LFT ecosystem become much, much
more mass, consumer friendly, you know,

361
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,570
ultimately the team I'll just read it.

362
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,920
Engaged in seeing and visionary and
metaverse is also a part of something that

363
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,580
called I was looking at quite heavily and
has been part of the vision from day one.

364
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,550
You know, here there's a vision
with NFTs and the Mexicans.

365
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,649
So for us, it's a good fit.

366
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,970
Speaking of the last summit we
collaborated on something that

367
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,360
involved the digital world that
was created for this summit and

368
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,860
Terra virtual was involved in this.

369
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,200
So can you tell us about
that project and where did.

370
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,610
So basically we provide a series of NFTs.

371
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,440
They were designed by Cardo themselves.

372
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,280
Now, what was really interesting
about this whole thing was because as

373
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,280
we were moving our platform towards
car data, we weren't there yet.

374
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,020
So we were already at an FTE's, which
are based on lithium that's one polygon.

375
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,780
We went there, we participated
in the conference and then we did

376
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,920
the first stage was just allocate
the assets to people with wallets.

377
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,820
So that actually had them as digital
assets, but they weren't true.

378
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:42,575
What we were actually then going
to do was mince them as NFTs

379
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:47,105
and allow them to be usable and
viewable in our 3d environments.

380
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:51,485
We have metaverse environments
we've already built and also have

381
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:53,735
the available, you know, in the
galleries, et cetera, et cetera.

382
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:57,245
And we're what we've been doing
right now for the last few months

383
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:58,805
is actually making it so that.

384
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,660
They can be minted they're already
in people's inventories where they

385
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,370
can't be mean to this true NFTs.

386
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,210
And then they can be moved in and out
of Terra virtual and everything else.

387
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,290
But there was a whole bunch of things
along the way that we discovered to make

388
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,080
our platform compatible with Cardona.

389
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,550
But like we're at the point now where
we should be able to within a few weeks

390
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,350
have those assets minted out to users.

391
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,129
And when we came up with one
approach and then we, after talking

392
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,139
to the team, we've actually.

393
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,390
Making it so that people can
actually self mint their assets.

394
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,410
So with that being said what, what else
can we expect in the future from Terra

395
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,510
Virtua, basically to date Tara virtual.

396
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,750
When we launched a year and a half
ago, we launched a mobile application

397
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,050
that did automated reality,
which allowed you to view NFTs.

398
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:48,630
We had an NFT marketplace and then
also we had our metaverse environments.

399
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,510
And that's the interesting thing about us.

400
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:57,315
If you look at the assets that we've
made, historically, we've collaborated

401
00:24:57,315 --> 00:25:00,795
with studios, you've got Mecca Godzilla,
which is like over a million polygons.

402
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:01,815
You've got lost in space.

403
00:25:01,815 --> 00:25:02,595
You've got godfather.

404
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:06,795
We created this really lovely,
3d, fully rigged assets.

405
00:25:07,515 --> 00:25:09,405
And that's where we're very,
very different because.

406
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:13,080
We were going to move towards
the metaverse and in fact,

407
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,610
what we have online now.

408
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,300
So there's a massive Terrordome
where you can walk around Godzilla

409
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,989
and see Khan beating his chest, et
cetera, and a smaller, more intimate

410
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:23,370
space where you can put your artwork.

411
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,969
These will take him out of a
much, much wider environment.

412
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:28,709
So right now we're going back to.

413
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:34,050
Imminently within a few months, you're
going to see like whole metaverse spaces,

414
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:39,870
which are fully customizable with you're
able to theme everything, bringing

415
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,950
it these from the outside, be able to
scale assets and items and have them

416
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:49,440
run an Uber high fidelity and web GL,
because this was one of the learnings

417
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,040
we had, you know, we, we had a desktop
environment, but like when you do that,

418
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,870
when people want convenience, You lose
out on, on users and you lose out other

419
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,520
community and you're providing utility.

420
00:25:59,520 --> 00:25:59,820
You are.

421
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,480
So we've been building two environments
simultaneously, which will live side

422
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,920
by side, and that then follows on
with the terabytes of space station.

423
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,520
And then after that, we can
go multiple worlds that can be

424
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,840
released at the end of the year.

425
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,360
We are actually building
a universe with multiple.

426
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,910
So, yeah.

427
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,530
Okay.

428
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,390
So so not only people being able to meet
their own things, but creating a space

429
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,280
station and a world and and multiple
other universes, lots going on with Terra

430
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,840
Virtua, how do they keep up with you?

431
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,100
How do people to stay involved?

432
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,920
A new mobile application is going
to be released within two weeks.

433
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,270
We have our Twitters and our
discords and everything else, but.

434
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,440
This is where we can see embracing
the community, providing a lot of

435
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,430
really interesting things to them,
including real-time drops real-time

436
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:50,380
comms, and also allowing people to do
very interesting things with assets.

437
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,380
You know, more than this here is let's
look at it and hope to speculate.

438
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,480
The future of NFTs is utility.

439
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,360
You know, doing things with
the stuff you have, right.

440
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,310
A good example right now is
one of our partnerships with

441
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,719
a company called Lightro.

442
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,610
And you'll be able to use that NFT
cause then you can get onto a virtual,

443
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:13,199
which I expect to have a Cardona range,
which are for chordoma community and

444
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,389
allow them to race the cars heads ahead.

445
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:19,229
And if I lose against you, you get
to keep our coats and sell the parts.

446
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,880
I'm really looking forward to seeing this.

447
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,080
I'm sure a lot of our viewers are so
make sure to check out Tara virtual.

448
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,650
All of their information is going
to be in the metadata below July.

449
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,990
Thanks so much for joining
us and carved out on 360.

450
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,480
So keep an eye out for more
from Tara virtuous soon.

451
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,570
And as I cryptically promised at the
start of the show today, there'll

452
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,889
be more NFT fund to follow at the
end of today's 360 with a special

453
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:45,450
greeting from someone you might know.

454
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,800
So stay tuned for that.

455
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,430
Meanwhile, the core development
team behind the scenes continues

456
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,899
to build car Dano itself.

457
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,860
Now here's John Kevin and Nigel to
update us, including what's to be

458
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,200
expected from June's vessel, heart Falk.

459
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,160
So John Kevin Nigel.

460
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,090
Welcome again.

461
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,000
We're going to talk about the vessel
hard-fought today, but before we do

462
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,150
Nigel, can you give us a little bit
of an overview of the major release

463
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,130
schedule and the philosophy behind that?

464
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:12,550
Sure.

465
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,270
Tim, as you may recall, we've opted
to concentrate efforts around three

466
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,560
significant releases per year, and
that's in February, June and October.

467
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:24,705
This enables our product teams to
focus on our core improvements while

468
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:28,665
we give the community plenty of lead
time necessary to prepare for any

469
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,365
significant changes and, or a hard fork.

470
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:35,265
And as our community grows, this
becomes more and more important

471
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:37,125
because that company that's out.

472
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:41,015
We'll want to take advantage of
the improvements we're building and

473
00:28:41,015 --> 00:28:43,805
they'll need lead sign to be able to
integrate that into their development

474
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,195
cycles while we'll still release
smaller improvements throughout the

475
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:51,245
year, developers should look to these
three milestones as the benchmarks.

476
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:55,355
What we've outlined in our ways
to scale could Arno this year in

477
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:57,485
February, we didn't need a hard fork.

478
00:28:57,755 --> 00:29:01,085
Those are normally needed
when we've got ledger changes.

479
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:05,525
However, these updates do take
us on the road towards the

480
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:06,995
basil hard-fought coming into.

481
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,360
And just to recap, here's
what we did in February.

482
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,860
We delivered the CD DL compatible
translation straight out of the CLI.

483
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,060
We did the infrastructure changes
necessary for incremental multisignature

484
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,230
where you put in a leadership schedule,
a mentor, transaction monitoring,

485
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,090
and also our script cost estimates.

486
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:29,325
But today what we're going to talk
about as the key Vasyl components

487
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:34,005
and that's our police version to
our script, collateral handling and

488
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,465
enhancements to our crypto premesis.

489
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:37,395
Thanks, Nigel.

490
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:42,465
And indeed, let's dive straight into
Plutus and Kevin now, Kevin Plutus of

491
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:46,935
course is a maturing smart contract
language, still a lots of enhancements

492
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:50,505
and improvements to go June of course,
is going to bring some significant.

493
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:52,574
Yeah, absolutely 10.

494
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:56,445
So the, these are just the first of
many improvements that we're going to

495
00:29:56,445 --> 00:30:00,675
be rolling out Plutus and for vassal
in June, they're going to be four

496
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,135
key areas that we're focusing on.

497
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:06,584
The first one will be referenced scripts.

498
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:10,514
What these are, are on chain prerecorded.

499
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,290
Scripts that we can then refer
to from other transactions.

500
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,360
And what that means is that we will
be able to reduce the size of the

501
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,980
transactions that use the scripts.

502
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,340
And as I said, we'll
also be able to get to.

503
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:25,515
Of existing code.

504
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:27,705
So a great improvement
for adaptive elephants.

505
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:34,395
The second thing that we're rolling out
is reference inputs with reference inputs.

506
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:38,535
What you can do is you can refer
to an input in, from within a

507
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:40,425
script without consuming it.

508
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:44,745
And what that does is to allow many
scripts to refer to the same input at the

509
00:30:44,745 --> 00:30:47,505
same time that improves our concurrency.

510
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:50,115
You can do many things
simultaneously using the.

511
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,230
Inputs a great improvement
to throughput from that.

512
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:58,159
The third thing are inline Daytons.

513
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,200
And what inline Dayton's do
is they make it easier for

514
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,300
developers to refer to a simple.

515
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,990
So we don't have to use hashes for inputs.

516
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,300
For example, we can just
refer to them directly.

517
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,810
It makes it easier for users
and developers to see the input.

518
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,460
So three great improvements.

519
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,250
These are covered by various CIPS that
we've put forward to the community that

520
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,379
have been commented on by various experts.

521
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Our CIP 33 reference screens.

522
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,730
CRP 31 reference input
CIP 32 inline Daytons.

523
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,770
And the final thing that we're going
to be rolling out our redeemers

524
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,840
in transaction information and
what this starts is to let strips

525
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,690
cooperate by using a shared Redeemer.

526
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,950
So for great improvements there now,
John Crips, I primitives, we're not

527
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,490
talking about some of the people we
meet on crypto Twitter every day.

528
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,815
Yeah, not this time,
Tim, not, not this time.

529
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:59,125
We use a lot of really
cool crypto in car dyno.

530
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:02,665
In fact, state of the art, and maybe
another time I could talk about the

531
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:06,145
elliptic curve primitives we use
because we use this primitive called

532
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:09,505
82 5 5 1 9 and it's state of the
art in terms of digital signatures.

533
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:10,075
Super cool.

534
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:14,335
Today, I want to just focus on, on a
change we've made around the VRF now, VRF.

535
00:32:15,202 --> 00:32:16,055
Cryptographic primitive.

536
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:18,275
And when I say primitive, it's
like little Lego bricks, little

537
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:21,635
building blocks that we, that we
build more complicated systems from.

538
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,875
So the VRF stands for a
verifiable, random function.

539
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,815
And normally when you're signing
something, you pass in the message

540
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:30,185
you're signing in the secret key,
and then you go through an algorithm

541
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:31,145
and you get a signature out.

542
00:32:31,205 --> 00:32:31,385
Okay.

543
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:32,945
That signature can be verified by people.

544
00:32:32,945 --> 00:32:36,665
And that's that's I think fairly
well understood by most folks.

545
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:38,075
The VRF is a little bit different.

546
00:32:38,075 --> 00:32:39,755
You put in a, a secret key.

547
00:32:39,815 --> 00:32:40,055
Okay.

548
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:42,965
So you need a secret, you still
need a private key, but you also

549
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:44,285
put in a kind of a random seat.

550
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,260
A piece of random data and during the
algorithm, rather than get a signature

551
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,980
out, you actually get a, what we call
a proof and another random output.

552
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,830
And this random output is
actually indistinguishable

553
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,180
from complete random noise.

554
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,420
And anyway, you start to give
it any kind of an insight.

555
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,120
Into how the VRF works.

556
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,340
And it's basically something
that takes the seed under secret.

557
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,719
And producers are proof on an
output, but we use this for our

558
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,219
deterministic leadership schedule.

559
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,459
So it's a very important aspect of
how we decide who's going to mint a

560
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,729
block next, anyway, it's expensive.

561
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,735
So with all these kinds of cryptography,
Then the math tends to be quite heavy.

562
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:23,165
They're expensive for computers
to basically calculate.

563
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:27,215
So we were using this twice and now
we've reduced that we've now managed

564
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:30,725
to kind of during the block propagation
process, rather than having two VRF

565
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,525
runs to two calculations, we not only.

566
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,790
So by doing this, we're
removing redundancy.

567
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,440
We're again, doing less work during our
validation and propagation of the block.

568
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,640
And this is all good news.

569
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,060
Now thing is whenever you remove something
like that's so technical like this,

570
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,640
you've got to be very careful how you,
how you surgically slice it out and

571
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,290
make sure that we truly don't need it.

572
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,190
But we've done this in a way where
we're faster, quicker, better, but

573
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,220
at the same time, just as secure,
just as deterministic as we were.

574
00:33:57,065 --> 00:34:00,215
Thank you, John script, collateral
adjustment is the next thing

575
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:00,935
that we're going to cover.

576
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:02,249
Kevin, perhaps you can take that one.

577
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:05,135
We're executing a Plutus smart contract.

578
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:08,495
What we do is we have
a two phase validation.

579
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:14,485
And in the first phase, a
script is executed our offline.

580
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,335
We check that it's going to succeed and
only if it goes through the first place,

581
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:22,815
the validation do we then put it forward
for execution actually on the chain.

582
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:24,675
So that's the second phase of validation.

583
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:29,715
Now, what we don't want is
to have a scripts, excuse me.

584
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,810
That haven't been paid for.

585
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:37,450
So we require users to put up collateral
to cover the cost of executing the script.

586
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:42,370
And if the second phase failed,
then the collateral is low.

587
00:34:43,154 --> 00:34:48,014
So this means that if you deliberately
submit a transaction on the chain

588
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:50,745
that you know is going to fail,
you've always had the chance to

589
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:52,754
check that through the first phase.

590
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:57,825
Then you're going to pay the collateral
cost for executing the script.

591
00:34:57,825 --> 00:35:01,575
And that way you can't attack the
chain by submitting a huge number of

592
00:35:01,575 --> 00:35:03,814
failing scripts, not having to pay for.

593
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:08,725
So with the current collateral
mechanism, what happens is you

594
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:14,035
put up an input and ADA input, and
if you, the transaction fails to

595
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:18,835
execute, then all of the collateral
is lost and there's a minimum value

596
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:20,605
associated with that, which is great.

597
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,310
Then the cost of actually
executing the script.

598
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,500
There's really no incentive
to try to attack the chain.

599
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:34,700
This way, what we've done is to make a
few improvements that will help a DRP user

600
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,150
realize that this process marks it's quite
effective is perhaps a bit draconian.

601
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:45,360
Doesn't quite meet all of the user needs
that we're seeing from adapt developers.

602
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,960
So what we're going to do, first of
all, is we're going to just collect.

603
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:52,384
So that it's the exact required amount.

604
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:56,345
And then the energy is never risks,
more collateral than they need to.

605
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,535
So you can put up 1,000,008.

606
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:01,265
I know you're a, you're
a whale, Tim, perhaps.

607
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:05,884
So you put up your million Asia and
in the old system, if you deliberately

608
00:36:05,884 --> 00:36:09,005
submitted a transaction that failed,
you would have lost your million ADA.

609
00:36:09,215 --> 00:36:10,415
That's a bit tough.

610
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:12,725
Now, if you do it, you'll be losing.

611
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:18,529
Much less say that'll be some percentage
of the actual script execution cost.

612
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:19,970
So a few ADA instead.

613
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,410
So that should make you much happier.

614
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,790
You won't be risking your, your
pot as collateral all the time, the

615
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,520
rest goes into a new change dress.

616
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,920
So you can specify where
the change goes to.

617
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,589
And of course, Kevin, that's a,
that's not the only improvement.

618
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,865
No, absolutely not.

619
00:36:35,865 --> 00:36:41,774
So several improvements coming
from this same draft CIP the first

620
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:45,605
of which is that you're no longer
going to be restricted to ADA.

621
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:49,964
Only tokens will allow you to
use non-native tokens, aware

622
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:51,254
of a lot of DAP developers.

623
00:36:51,464 --> 00:36:51,754
They.

624
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,320
ADA and Nonata within the same UTX house.

625
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,570
This can make it much easier, much simpler
for that developers to use this mechanism.

626
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:07,380
And the second improvement is that
this process is going to work much

627
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,960
better with hardware, wallets,
hardware, wallets will need.

628
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:14,275
That the transaction will, will succeed.

629
00:37:14,305 --> 00:37:19,465
There'll be ways to check that and that
will give users scriptures as much more

630
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:24,325
confidence and certainty in the use
of polluters strips with collateral.

631
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:24,655
Cool.

632
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:25,525
Thank you, Kevin.

633
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:28,885
And of course, if you want to check
out the sip process and some of those

634
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:32,815
steps that are in flight at the moment,
we'll put a link in the notes below.

635
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:36,625
So John aside, these Plutus improvements,
there's obviously going to be some

636
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:38,635
continuing work on the network.

637
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:39,735
Perhaps you want to tell us more.

638
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:41,580
Absolutely Tim.

639
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:42,540
So, yeah.

640
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,420
We're going to be making
large changes this summer.

641
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,960
When we roll out a pipelining, I
know there was a blog that was out

642
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,470
there by one of our distinguished
researchers, Mathias, Fitzy.

643
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,380
I wanted to give people a little
bit of insight because I think

644
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,640
that blog was quite technical.

645
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,180
And when people read it, maybe it's not
clear exactly what we're delivering.

646
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,330
So I want to, I want to try to clear up
any misconceptions out there around this.

647
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,800
So whenever we're rolling.

648
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:09,085
Stuff like this, it starts, you
know, the seed starts with research.

649
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:12,995
They spend all day thinking
about this kind of stuff and, and

650
00:38:13,015 --> 00:38:14,185
coming up with different models.

651
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:15,505
And it's all very academic.

652
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:20,095
At that point it's not very, it's, there's
no code, it's more thought and process.

653
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:23,725
And then we kind of, as, as these
things take shape, these enhancements,

654
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:27,085
they make, whether it's pipelining or
otherwise, as it takes shape, it becomes

655
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,065
more concrete, more real, more tangible.

656
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:31,435
And we think, okay, yeah, this is
something we can actually make a change

657
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,694
to, and it will have real impact for the.

658
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,900
That process then goes to, to folks
like me in the architecture section.

659
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,000
And I will take the research input.

660
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:42,509
That's my job to take that and turn
it into a more tangible specification.

661
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,580
We call it an engineering
spec or architectural spec.

662
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:49,529
And then indeed it goes to the guys who do
the actual work, the engineers and they,

663
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:52,140
they take my work and then they write the
code and that's how, that's how we do it.

664
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,279
And I think folks who maybe
read Matthias's blog he speaking

665
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:57,540
from a very academic standpoint.

666
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,810
So there, when we, what we've
been calling pipelining on the.

667
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,270
It's really about getting the blocks
transmitted faster to your neighbor.

668
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,520
And I've discussed that before,
because the faster the blocks can

669
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,940
transmit, the more kind of headroom we
have to increase network parameters,

670
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,230
make things faster, bigger, better.

671
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,900
When Mathias is thinking about
this, he's not thinking about,

672
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,030
about the, the downstream impact.

673
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:21,060
He's very focused on, on, on
all of the different variants of

674
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,960
pipeline and that you can have.

675
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,720
So you might've heard words
like pipelining, diffusion,

676
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,540
pipelining, a synchronous
validation, delayed validation.

677
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:34,080
They're all different flavors of the
same idea, which is to bring together

678
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,790
the process of validating a block
whilst you're also communicating and

679
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,649
transmitting the data as fast as possible.

680
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,490
Now, when we're selecting, which one
of the brilliant ideas, our research

681
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,819
geniuses come up with, we have to do
so with a pragmatic hat on, because

682
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,540
we have to say to ourselves, This this
version, they synchronous validation.

683
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,270
Maybe it's a little bit faster, but it's
more dangerous and it needs more time.

684
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,480
So we've chosen what we're
calling diffusion pipelining.

685
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:57,840
Okay.

686
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,750
And that's why I call it a pipelining
on the show, which we feel as a suite.

687
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:05,220
Which will deliver plenty of
headroom for amazing changes to

688
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,149
come for the rest of the year.

689
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,580
So we may go back and look at
other things like asynchronous

690
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,509
validation and other things that
lead to to even higher throughput.

691
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:16,720
But you gotta remember we are
already ahead in terms of our, our

692
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,227
performance roadmap as is where we were.

693
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,970
Our block utilization is still
not at a hundred percent.

694
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,550
We have a big changes coming in June.

695
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,980
That's going to let us really
ramp up the network parameters

696
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,290
and increase block size and speed.

697
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,650
And yeah.

698
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,090
Then on top of that, just compounding.

699
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,370
We may never end up doing a different
variant of pipelining because

700
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,040
actually I believe what we're going
to bring in June is going to be

701
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,480
the sweet spot and we'll be enough.

702
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,759
And then we're going to be moving
to input endorsers, which is a

703
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:45,779
radically different way of doing
consensus and doing block propagation.

704
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:46,980
And we can talk about that in detail.

705
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,250
Another time effectively, you have
ranking blocks and input blocks, and

706
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,390
it's, it's all quite sophisticated, but
I think pipelining and the way we're

707
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,799
bringing it in June is going to be.

708
00:40:56,399 --> 00:41:00,270
Headroom until input endorsers
comes, which is effectively an

709
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,080
end game solution that will see us
scale out for the next five years.

710
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,330
Thank you, John, for that overview Nigel.

711
00:41:06,629 --> 00:41:11,939
So work continues a pace on preparing
for the June facile hard-fought, but

712
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:14,819
of course, October is coming down
the line and it'll arrive sooner

713
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:18,270
than we think that's going to be
called the Chang hard fork as well.

714
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,000
A few bits and pieces
being worked on right now.

715
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,540
What's the update.

716
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,560
Of course, Tim, our team is starting
to plan for the Chang hard fork in

717
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,150
October and while the full scope is
still in development which will change

718
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,590
over the coming weeks and months.

719
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,330
We definitely know certain things
that are going to be in the pipeline

720
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,420
for October and our community
can look forward to seeing.

721
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,970
And more about these in the near future.

722
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,340
We've got changes in
the area of governance.

723
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,000
We've got more smart contracts,
evolution, we've got more changes

724
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,530
and improvements to performance.

725
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,990
And of course that's just
the core development.

726
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,990
As we've shared previously, we've got also
lots of other exciting things coming in

727
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,940
the pipeline from light wallets to site.

728
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:01,535
Thank you Nigel.

729
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:05,285
So I hope as you can see a huge amount
of work going on for June, and we're

730
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:09,245
also thinking ahead to October already,
gentlemen, thank you very much for

731
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:10,535
joining us and we'll see you again.

732
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:15,065
See another great update
from the team there.

733
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:19,025
Now let's check out some of the projects
building on Codonics wing writers,

734
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:21,845
JPEG store are gone and Typhon wallet.

735
00:42:25,595 --> 00:42:25,955
This week.

736
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:28,265
I got a chance to speak with
some of the teams building on.

737
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,320
We spoke with JPEG store Typhon wallet.

738
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,180
I had gone interviewing writers.

739
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,870
So tell us what is your mission
and how is it different from other

740
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,490
pre-existing solutions on the market?

741
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,600
My name's Liam.

742
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,610
I'm from a project called wing writers.

743
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,370
We're building a decentralized
exchange on Caetano.

744
00:42:45,705 --> 00:42:49,575
We're powered by vacuum labs,
which means we come from one of the

745
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:53,535
longest working development shops
in the space overall longer term.

746
00:42:53,535 --> 00:42:57,225
Our mission is really to be a layer
of the infrastructure and Caetano,

747
00:42:57,315 --> 00:43:00,944
you know, dApps and other platforms
or projects that are building on

748
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:05,984
Caetano are going to require someone
who can do swaps for them very

749
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:09,345
securely and safely, and can integrate
really deeply into their platforms.

750
00:43:09,525 --> 00:43:10,665
So that's who we want to be.

751
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:11,384
So we're in June.

752
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,940
We're the largest NFT
marketplace on car dauno.

753
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,680
And our mission is really to grow
car Dano and bring as much users

754
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,690
as we can into our ecosystem.

755
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:28,029
We're a fun, vibrant, funky, and Ft
marketplace, and we're bringing lots of

756
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:29,968
exciting new features to our platform.

757
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:34,200
Such as offers auctions trading profiles.

758
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:37,140
We also have a launchpad for creators.

759
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,310
We're really trying to bring more creators
into the space and make it as easy as

760
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,650
possible for them to create on Cardinal.

761
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,750
When we launched, we were also, I
think the first NFT marketplace on

762
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,060
Kronos fully integrated with royalties.

763
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:52,190
So working.

764
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:56,595
Creators and supporting them has
really been a big mission for us.

765
00:43:56,595 --> 00:44:00,225
Since the beginning I got mission
is to create a decentralized cloud

766
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:06,015
computing marketplace enabling us to
contribute, to and make use of secure,

767
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:09,345
private self sovereign cloud platform.

768
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:11,295
Our fall shower sharding.

769
00:44:12,273 --> 00:44:18,485
And sharding mechanism, distribution model
based on the learning, the behavior of

770
00:44:18,485 --> 00:44:23,975
our resource providers enables us to store
files in nos that fit their requirements.

771
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,175
This goes in, hand-in-hand
such as for GDPR compliance.

772
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:31,865
If you want to be a green
eco-friendly project green

773
00:44:31,865 --> 00:44:35,915
energy use and high-performance
et cetera we had type one.

774
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,835
All it are positioning ourselves.

775
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:42,090
From a ground zero approach
of, of development.

776
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,270
The core libraries that
are used by wallets for

777
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,480
generating  signing transactions.

778
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,110
I've built from ground zero in
pure JavaScript by our developers.

779
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,240
And we are addressing the
gap in the ecosystem by.

780
00:44:58,455 --> 00:45:02,444
Giving features to the users which
are not available in some of the

781
00:45:02,444 --> 00:45:06,134
wallets or were not available earlier
when we launched diamond wallet

782
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:10,424
things like attaching metadata to
a transaction and allowing users to

783
00:45:10,424 --> 00:45:12,255
send multiple tokens in a transaction.

784
00:45:12,615 --> 00:45:14,685
What are the advantages
of building on Cordato?

785
00:45:14,775 --> 00:45:17,355
Why are you in Cardona
as opposed to any other.

786
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:19,665
There's really two pieces.

787
00:45:19,905 --> 00:45:24,405
The first piece is the functional approach
in programming languages on Caetano.

788
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:26,895
Brian is very much makes a difference.

789
00:45:27,345 --> 00:45:31,455
And the second piece is the whole sort
of philosophy behind Cardona to move a

790
00:45:31,455 --> 00:45:33,285
little bit slower and maybe consider.

791
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:36,975
Problems from a little bit, a
little bit more of a strategic

792
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:38,475
level, make sense, right?

793
00:45:38,475 --> 00:45:41,175
If you look over the last 12
months, there's more and more

794
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:42,615
people building on Cardona.

795
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:46,425
And I think largely it's driven by those,
those two reasons, the functional aspect

796
00:45:46,515 --> 00:45:50,175
and the kind of, long-term more considered
approach to development of the space.

797
00:45:50,595 --> 00:45:54,465
One of the best things about the
Cardona ecosystem is the community.

798
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:55,815
From the beginning, we.

799
00:45:56,395 --> 00:46:00,505
So much support and love from
the people inside Cardona.

800
00:46:00,805 --> 00:46:03,775
And I think anyone who's trying
to build something unique and

801
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,855
interesting for our ecosystem is
going to get the same type of support.

802
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:11,815
The reason why we chose to build
on Cardona in the first place is

803
00:46:11,815 --> 00:46:14,935
just because of the vision and
the mission behind the blockchain.

804
00:46:15,265 --> 00:46:20,575
We really, really resonated with
Cardona's a fully decentralized.

805
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,430
Like the people's blockchain.

806
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,490
We love what they're doing in Africa.

807
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,660
Cardona is really focused
on real-world applications.

808
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,690
I think it can bring a lot
more people on board with the

809
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,610
technology and into the ecosystem.

810
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:36,930
In general, we see.

811
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,980
Being a blockchain that's
truly going to take crypto.

812
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,850
It's a mass market.

813
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:42,240
Yeah.

814
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,950
We can talk for a down a lot.

815
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,910
I mean there could go on a long time,
but I'll just list a few points there

816
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,260
that, that stand out the most it security
decentralization, which kind of go hand

817
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:58,110
in hand research-driven approach you
know, building up, studying the models

818
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:02,790
before they actually implement the
code capital efficiency ecosystem and

819
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,770
future potential, which is in Africa.

820
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:10,254
People that don't have
that capacity, right?

821
00:47:10,435 --> 00:47:16,495
We are in Chicano from 2017 and I'm,
I'm a, I'm a computer science graduate.

822
00:47:16,495 --> 00:47:21,085
So I love technology and
Cardenas technology is what

823
00:47:21,115 --> 00:47:22,645
brought me into the ecosystem.

824
00:47:22,645 --> 00:47:29,205
So We actually built CareNow
scan the Explorer earlier.

825
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:30,975
And then we started
building type and wallets.

826
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:34,004
So our low bit Carano is, is
the technology, the technical

827
00:47:34,004 --> 00:47:35,444
foundation of Caetano.

828
00:47:35,835 --> 00:47:40,694
And then when the catalyst
launched it provided us a great

829
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:43,125
platform to find our work.

830
00:47:43,214 --> 00:47:45,884
And then we went fully independent
and now we are working fully

831
00:47:45,884 --> 00:47:48,855
independent into Cardona ecosystem,
and we are really happy with.

832
00:47:49,605 --> 00:47:50,415
So how's it going?

833
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:51,465
What stage are you at now?

834
00:47:51,645 --> 00:47:54,675
So w we've put out our test
nets, we're moving to main net

835
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,255
in about a week to seven days.

836
00:47:57,615 --> 00:48:01,995
We've gone through a security audit
by cirrhotic, which was finished

837
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:03,375
and we put a blog post out about it.

838
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:04,245
About a week ago.

839
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:06,882
We're doing just our final
security testing with our own.

840
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:09,255
I'm on squished through that.

841
00:48:09,255 --> 00:48:11,625
We'll move to my net and then we'll
sort of make more announcements.

842
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:14,654
But yeah, our plan is to
get this done pretty quick.

843
00:48:14,865 --> 00:48:18,705
We're integrated with a bunch of
different wallets, Flint, 60 volt

844
00:48:18,705 --> 00:48:22,275
NAMI and then a new fire as well.

845
00:48:22,575 --> 00:48:27,345
So we're fully launched, like we said
earlier, we are the largest empty

846
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:31,245
marketplace on Cardona and we've
held that position for three months.

847
00:48:32,174 --> 00:48:36,134
But we're now at a stage where we're
profitable and we're hiring grafts.

848
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:45,405
So we're looking for engineers, community
managers, marketers, the best talent we

849
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:47,705
can get inside of the ecosystem to really.

850
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:52,095
Take our marketplace to the
next level and start competing

851
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,325
with the other blockchains.

852
00:48:53,745 --> 00:48:57,885
I think we've basically refactored
the entire code base and migrated

853
00:48:57,885 --> 00:49:00,843
our database, which just went
live a couple of days ago.

854
00:49:01,365 --> 00:49:04,335
So now we're gonna switch and
focus on really pushing out

855
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:05,775
new features a lot faster.

856
00:49:05,775 --> 00:49:07,305
There's a lot of core functionality.

857
00:49:07,305 --> 00:49:10,485
We still want to get down like
auctions and offers, but there's

858
00:49:10,485 --> 00:49:15,495
also a lot of just new things we
want to bring to the ecosystem and.

859
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,500
Like find new ways to create features
that will be interesting for you.

860
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,970
Is it we're focusing first on
setting up the marketplace the award

861
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:27,720
scheme and a required infrastructure
around the shared storage economy.

862
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:33,240
At, at the time, at the moment
we're working on porting MVP we

863
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,890
presented to some of our partners.

864
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:41,080
In CodeNow and also in the traditional
space and we'll continue our testing on

865
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,640
the UI UX we're planning audits, following
the community testing and a thorough

866
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,500
testing phase prior to public launch.

867
00:49:48,705 --> 00:49:52,509
We just want to we just recently
released information on our ERC 20.

868
00:49:53,797 --> 00:49:59,250
Which integrates nomad, I'm a committer
and a very easy to use front end,

869
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:04,379
allowing users and projects to migrate
from ERC 20 to Coronado native tokens.

870
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,169
Tycon wallet is at a development
stage, which is a staple.

871
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,220
We are enhancing the features that,
that we have already developed.

872
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,490
We are improving the UI, the
user interface we have recently

873
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,410
redesigned the full wallet from.

874
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,779
Like pulling from scratch.

875
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,890
It's a new interface.

876
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:27,600
We introduced doc mode and now we
are venturing into other platforms

877
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,070
like mobile and tech stop.

878
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:32,190
So to launch and to find staying
power are two different things.

879
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,490
Post-launch what are a few
crucial milestones on the

880
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,580
path to you guys becoming a
permanent part of this ecosystem?

881
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:42,450
Crypto as a general rule, tends
to lean on that first part.

882
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,350
Extracting as much attention as possible
in the beginning, and then trying to

883
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,570
execute later we're very different.

884
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:53,050
We're developer led, you know, by being
associated with vacuum labs who are

885
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,640
very strong on the development side,
we're really trying to build a product

886
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:02,220
before we sort of progressed to any level
where we're trying to shill out product.

887
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,930
Like everyone's going to be
able to get on the test now.

888
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:04,910
Right.

889
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,610
That's very much aligned with our ethos.

890
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,690
So we think people seeing the product,
seeing our roadmap saying at the

891
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:14,690
functionality and improvements,
we're looking at over time, you

892
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,250
know, our roadmaps really build out.

893
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,420
We're adding more wallets.

894
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,590
We've got more features.

895
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,700
We've got staking in yield
farming, both coming.

896
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,960
So all of these things, I think delivering
like a constant supply of new features

897
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,310
and functionality, listening to.

898
00:51:29,315 --> 00:51:32,045
And then really addressing any
issues and shortcomings you have.

899
00:51:32,075 --> 00:51:33,965
I think that tide makes
you more sustainable.

900
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:36,035
I can power again, our mission.

901
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:39,725
Now that we're number one is to
really start bringing more users to

902
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:41,795
Cardona and growing the ecosystem.

903
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:42,425
So.

904
00:51:43,486 --> 00:51:47,445
We're trying to find new artists
and creators to partner up with as

905
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:52,065
well as supporting the incredible
existing ones that have already

906
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:54,105
built collections here on Cardona.

907
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:56,835
We can also grow our launchpad more.

908
00:51:57,645 --> 00:52:02,385
We're looking to hire a large private
manager there, and I think there's a lot

909
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,115
of documentation that we can create to
help people with the minting process.

910
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:12,255
Just, yeah, get more resources out there
to make it easier for people to create.

911
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:18,495
And bring more of like, Into the
ecosystem if achieving proper

912
00:52:18,495 --> 00:52:22,515
decentralization and a sufficient
node coverage to offer secure GDPR

913
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:27,855
compliance are important steps towards
delivering on potential of our solution.

914
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:33,134
In addition, key partnerships, such as
our joint venture program with genius.

915
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:39,509
And also, and our expansion as he to
our NMT repetition model are important

916
00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:40,650
milestones that are in launch.

917
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,930
In addition to development of our public
storage social platform called after we

918
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:50,970
launched the wallet we want to continue
to build this wallet and continue

919
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,799
to upgrade as, and when the Cardinal
heart Cardinal upgrades, heart-focused

920
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:58,440
into new and new era, we have so many
hard folks planned for this year.

921
00:52:58,589 --> 00:52:59,610
It's going to be next year.

922
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,380
So we are not stopping here.

923
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,580
We are driving to.

924
00:53:03,399 --> 00:53:05,230
Lauren and lock features into the wallet.

925
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,490
One more thing to mention.

926
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,640
We also launched that
connector a while ago.

927
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:14,620
So it's a unique approach
again from the CIP.

928
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:19,120
And we are also building out more
and more features and documentation

929
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,620
around that connector for different.

930
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:24,009
How do you see your project niche
developing on Cordato and in the

931
00:53:24,009 --> 00:53:26,020
wider industry over the longterm?

932
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:30,549
And what problems do you feel that your
project is uniquely positioned to it?

933
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,150
Let me start with the second part first.

934
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,990
I mean, I think the first part is
if you're not building I've been

935
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,460
in crypto about six, seven years.

936
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,970
If you're not really building
effectively with a good development

937
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,090
team, then essentially in this
industry, you're just marketing, right?

938
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:48,450
Like you're leveraging someone
else's product to package it

939
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,040
together with some sort of concept.

940
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:55,290
Where the other end of the spectrum,
like we have we a backbone lab,

941
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:57,029
very, very strong development team.

942
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,939
That's the way, you know, we didn't come
out of stealth until we're a hundred

943
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:02,430
percent sure that we could execute
and what we're trying to execute.

944
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:05,399
We tend to be probably more
risk averse than other projects.

945
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,430
You know, we speak pretty regularly
about how we're structuring our

946
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:12,689
product how we're approaching defy
and those types of opportunities.

947
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,740
We talk to our compliance team.

948
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,630
We talk to our legal advisors, right?

949
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,630
So w we're trying to obviously
build a project that's sustainable.

950
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,420
So all of our users can use
us for a long time to come.

951
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:27,850
We're planning to incorporate you peg
store as a B corporation, where a portion

952
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:32,560
of our company's profits will actually go
towards environmental and social causes.

953
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:35,595
And this is something we're
really passionate about.

954
00:54:35,745 --> 00:54:41,325
We think we can build a company that
is truly different and focused on our

955
00:54:41,325 --> 00:54:46,815
community and Cardinal and, and gives
back rather than just extracting.

956
00:54:47,265 --> 00:54:51,435
And we hope that this will pave the way
for future entrepreneurs to follow in our.

957
00:54:52,379 --> 00:54:56,729
We're uniquely positioned to provide a
decentralization, decentralized compute

958
00:54:56,729 --> 00:55:01,524
services, resources, to projects, wanting
to build truly user solving applications

959
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:06,990
and believe we can make, make a positive
contribution to the development that's

960
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,790
taking place in the third world countries.

961
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:12,060
So somewhat similar to
what cradle is doing, where

962
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,100
possible through partnerships.

963
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,930
Where we can contribute to these
countries that are in need.

964
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,890
We also think we will solve a
bigger barrier in adoption and

965
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:27,120
migration from traditional space to
the blockchain space, by providing

966
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,670
an easy to use clean interface.

967
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:33,120
We are in the ecosystem from a long
time, and we were observed observing

968
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,070
that there's so many features that
Cardinal has that were not being taken

969
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,230
advantage of by the wallet providers.

970
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,597
The, the users You know,
big becoming so much.

971
00:55:46,758 --> 00:55:50,220
It's, it's like the users when see
a wallet interface, they see, okay,

972
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,509
this is what Caetano does, but Carano
provides a lot more functionality.

973
00:55:55,062 --> 00:55:59,460
So that's where we came in the picture
providing so many features that were

974
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,500
not available with existing wallets.

975
00:56:01,785 --> 00:56:04,650
But Gaetano as a backend
technology does provide it.

976
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,270
This was one of the main features.

977
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,880
We, we provided a simple
interface for users.

978
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,490
The second transaction and
add a message along with it.

979
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:13,690
And any type of message.

980
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,100
Any kind of complex message, not just,
not just a, a text message, but like

981
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:22,120
a Jason, you know, like committed data
for a token, you could attach anything.

982
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:29,384
And there was another unique feature
of Cardona was ability to send, not

983
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:34,125
just one token, but more than that,
tens of hundreds of tokens, along with

984
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,925
the transaction, that's the main goal.

985
00:56:35,955 --> 00:56:40,245
That's the goal that we started building
type and wallet with allowing users

986
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:44,724
to utilize the core Carano technology.

987
00:56:45,404 --> 00:56:48,525
Thank you for joining us on the show today
and thank you to the audience for joining

988
00:56:48,525 --> 00:56:50,475
us also tune in next time for more.

989
00:56:52,904 --> 00:56:56,025
And of course, additional kudos to
wing rise there for their recent

990
00:56:56,025 --> 00:56:57,795
support of the mince swap team.

991
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:01,785
This community is as much a part of what
makes Cardona as special as the tech.

992
00:57:02,595 --> 00:57:06,615
Now remember defy is exciting, but
we're early be careful about that.

993
00:57:08,685 --> 00:57:11,205
So that's nearly a wrap
for March before we go.

994
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:15,214
A shout out to the team at DC spark,
who this week launched the middle COVID

995
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:19,365

car darnos interoperability journey.

996
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:26,040

middle Camilla for the ones that

997

Looking pretty good.

1000
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:36,780
for Carolina that allows for  to be
launched on the site, which is pretty cool

1001
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,680
because you can use ADA for everything
that's related to these idiom tabs.

1002
00:57:41,236 --> 00:57:44,760
Things are looking pretty well,
and I'm very excited to eventually

1003
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,640

more about what's going on.
